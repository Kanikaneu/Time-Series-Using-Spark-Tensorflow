# Time-Series-Using-Spark-Tensorflow

## Time Series Project under AI SkunkWorks

The repository has notebooks on ARIMA, FB Probhet and LSTM Models. The repository also has .dbc files which can be executed in databricks.
The output of the three models have been compared using the amazon stock prices dataset.

The code in the notebooks have been written by students from CSYE 7245 Big Data Systems and Intelligence Analytics course during Sprin 2019 as
part of their final project.
